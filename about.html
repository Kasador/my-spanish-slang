	<p class="about-para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first year of high school was when I first started learning Spanish. I was always interested in the Spanish language and even in middle school I remember wanting to learn it. After my first year, I fell in love with the language; taking it year after year until I graduated. By my senior year I was feeling pretty good with my Spanish, forming basic sentences and understanding little by little. It wasn’t until I went to Costa Rica after graduating that I realized I was far from fluent. I spent the summer there learning “Tico Spanish” and later feeling frustrated that it doesn’t translate well with Mexican Spanish. It was in Costa Rica I really learned that each country had its own version of Spanish. I remember thinking how could I possibly become even close to fluent if I had to understand the Spanish from each individual country – and I mean, there were twenty different countries that spoke Spanish. That made me even more obsessed with travelling; later going to Chile, Peru, and even Argentina. After a few years I realized is almost impossible to become “fluent” and it really would depend on each person and their definition of the word “fluent”. </p>
